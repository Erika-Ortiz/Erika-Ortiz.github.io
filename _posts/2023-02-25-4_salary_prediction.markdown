description: We developed a regression model that predicts NBA player salaries based on various features and analyzed how different features correlate with their salary. <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp Our technical objectives included defining a prediction task, selecting evaluation metrics, performing feature engineering and standardization, and training univariable and multivariable linear regression models, as well as a decision tree regressor. <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp We gathered data from the  <a class="plinks" href="https://github.com/swar/nba_api" target="_blank">NBA API</a> and split it into train/test sets, created a baseline model, trained a regressor model with a single feature, and then performed feature engineering before training a regressor model with multiple features.
