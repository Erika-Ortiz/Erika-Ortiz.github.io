description: We developed a regression model that predicts NBA player salaries based on various features and analyzed how different features correlate with their salary. Our technical objectives included defining a prediction task, selecting evaluation metrics, performing feature engineering and standardization, and training univariable and multivariable linear regression models, as well as a decision tree regressor. <br>We gathered data from the NBA API and split it into train/test sets, created a baseline model, trained a regressor model with a single feature, and then performed feature engineering before training a regressor model with multiple features.
