description: we developed a model to predict customer loan repayment ability. We handled datasets with thousands of rows and dozens of columns. We began with EDA and preprocessing tasks&colon; <br><br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;feature selection  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;outlier detection, and handling  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;feature imputation, normalization, and standardization  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;categorical feature encoding <br><br> &nbsp; After that, we created a baseline model and trained a random classifier, using randomized hyperparameter search with cross-validation. Then we used other ML algorithms like Random Forest and LightGBM, and performed hyperparameter search with CV, and streamlined the process with pipelines. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis of the results using ROC AUC as a metric for binary classification tasks.
