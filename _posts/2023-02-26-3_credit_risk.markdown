description: we developed a model to predict customer loan repayment ability. We handled datasets with thousands of rows and dozens of columns. We began with EDA and preprocessing tasks like feature selection, outlier detection, and handling, feature imputation, normalization, and standardization, as well as categorical feature encoding. We then created a baseline model and trained a random classifier, using randomized hyperparameter search with cross-validation. Then we used other ML algorithms like Random Forest and LightGBM, and performed hyperparameter search with CV, and streamlined the process with pipelines. Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis of the results using ROC AUC as a metric for binary classification tasks.
